Difference between abstract classes and interface

Abstract class → can’t create it
Has to have abstract methods → we have to implement them for a concrete class
Doesn’t have constructors


Concrete class → create it and can add it to the abstract class

Interface → give a list of methods which the object
Interface creates only the signatures of the methods

Signature of a method → what the method returns, name of the method and the params of the methods

Modificators → public/private + static/abstract etc

Main difference between abstract class and interface:
Abstract class defines the common parameters
Interface defines the common behaviours/ methods
